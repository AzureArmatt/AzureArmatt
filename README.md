Hey, I’m Matthew :wave: and I'm a young programmer that has lots of dreams and plans for the future.

I'm interested in many random things be it a good book, video game or even playing instrument. 
I used to swim a lot but few years ago i stopped (i hope to get back to it soon :smiley: )

I’m currently learning FrontEnd development here is the list of my progress:

   - ![img](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=CSS&message=&nbsp;&color=informational) :heavy_check_mark:
   - ![img](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Sass&message=&nbsp;&color=ff69b4) :heavy_check_mark:
   - ![img](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=JavaScript&message=&nbsp;&color=yellow) :heavy_check_mark: 
  
Of course there is even more practice before me and even more learning! :fire:

Here are plans for the future:

And also a couple of "extras" I would like to study once i posess knowledge above:

I'm doing all of this with hopes of becoming Fullstack developer in a future (FrontEnd dev for now)!
