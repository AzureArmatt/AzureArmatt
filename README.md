Hey, I’m Matthew :wave: and I'm a young programmer that has lots of dreams and plans for the future.

I'm interested in many random things be it a good book, video game or even playing instrument. 
I used to swim a lot but few years ago i stopped (i hope to get back to it soon :smiley: )

I’m currently learning FrontEnd development here is the list of my progress:
   - HTML :heavy_check_mark:
   - CSS  :heavy_check_mark:
   - JavaScript
   - SASS (with some advanced CSS) :heavy_check_mark:
  
Of course there is even more practice before me and even more learning! :fire:

Here are plans for the future:
   
   - React and/or Angular
   - Node.js
   - Express
   - MongoDB
  
I'm doing all of this with hopes of becoming Fullstack developer in a future (FrontEnd dev for now)!

If you are interested in talking with me, asking about anything or maybe giving me some guidance... you can find me here:
