# Hey, Iâ€™m Matthew :wave: 
> I'm a young programmer that has lots of ideas and plans for the future.

# Who am I? (My short story) ðŸ“–
> A Fresh graduate from University of Cardinal Stefan WyszyÅ„ski in Warsaw (UKSW). After the first semester I got hooked on programming and I decided that my goal is going to be to become a software engineer. At university I learned C/C++ and Java but I was mainly sticking with C++. When I entered my 3rd year I began feeling that C++ might not be my way (and I had many doubts about the future). In the way of unfortunate events I had to repeat a year and during that time pandemic happened which led to me staying at university another year due to slow work on my thesis. It was that time when I got inspired by listening to my friend about Web development and what things you can make. With the start of 2021 I decided to pick up the challenge of becoming a FrontEnd developer (and hopefully Fullstack developer in future). Right now I can't understand how this great world could stay out of my sight. I'm serious about discovering it's secrets and I keep on learning as much as I can to realize my dreams!

# Okay but... what about other things? ðŸŒ³
> I love swimming. After pandemic restrictions are lifted I'm definitely going to start training again to get back in shape! Other things I like include: reading books (fantasy), video games and playing guitar. I also enjoy reading articles about tech, space, planes and navy. I'm a fan of interesting conversation since through listening of others we can learn a lot ðŸ˜ƒ

Here are things I've learned so far on my journey:
